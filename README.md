# SPECs for COPR

This repository holds a collection of different SPEC files for different applications or utilities. Some of them (like devpod) are of general interest to anyone; others, like "backgrounds" are of a more personal nature.

All packages are built in [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/chronoscrat) and made available under different repositories.

Eventually I plan to include a README file in each subdirectory with more information about the packages.

### DevPod

The DevPod spec file is taken from [the uBlue packages](https://github.com/ublue-os/packages/blob/main/staging/devpod/devpod.spec).


### Backgrounds

A collection of wallpapers I normally use in my workstations. They generally include a configuration file for GNOME that enables changing the wallpaper according to the time of day.
